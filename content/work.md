# Work With Us

Mount Purpose supports leaders and organizations navigating the transition from success to significance. Whether you're in the valley or ascending your second mountain, we provide frameworks, guidance, and community for the journey.

## Individual Advisory

### Trusted Counsel for Leaders in Transition

You need a guide who understands the terrain—someone who's navigated the valley and knows what the ascent requires.

**This is for you if:**
- You've reached the summit and heard the whisper: *Is this all there is?*
- You're in the valley between mountains, uncertain of the path forward
- You're leading through significant transition (career change, organizational pivot, personal transformation)
- You need someone who can see what you can't see when you're in the middle of the journey

**What we work on:**
- Clarifying your values and principles when achievement metrics no longer satisfy
- Navigating organizational or career transitions with integrity
- Building sustainable practices for purpose-aligned leadership
- Reviewing communications, presentations, and public-facing materials
- Advising on reputation and digital presence during vulnerable moments
- Strategic counsel during challenging moments (lawsuits, media storms, crises)

**How we work:**
- Initial conversation to understand your journey and explore fit
- Ongoing guidance tailored to your specific transition (weekly, bi-weekly, or as-needed)
- Access to the Mount Purpose community and gatherings
- Direct support on critical moments and deliverables when needed

This isn't about doing the work for you. It's about having someone who understands both the mountain you're climbing and how to communicate from that elevation.

**Investment:** Advisory relationships typically range from $3,000-$5,000 per month depending on scope and intensity. We'll discuss what makes sense during our initial conversation.

## Organizational Consulting

### Strategic Guidance for Mission-Driven Organizations

Organizations, like individuals, navigate transitions from conventional success metrics toward deeper alignment between mission and authentic impact.

**This is for you if:**
- Your leadership team is seeking to align strategy with deeper purpose
- Your organization is navigating mission drift or cultural transformation
- You're scaling impact and need to maintain alignment
- Profit or growth alone isn't a sufficient north star anymore

**What we work on:**

**Mission Alignment**  
Ensuring strategy, culture, and operations reflect your deepest purpose—not just what sounds good in a mission statement.

**Leadership Development**  
Cultivating second-mountain thinking in your team. Teaching leaders to lead from purpose, not just performance.

**Organizational Transition**  
Guiding transformation during growth, pivots, or cultural shifts. Helping you navigate change without losing your soul.

**Purpose Integration**  
Moving from mission statements to lived values. Making purpose real in daily decisions and culture.

**Communication & Reputation**  
Crafting narratives that reflect who you're becoming. Ensuring your external story matches your internal transformation.

**Approach:**  
We don't offer one-size-fits-all solutions. Every organization's journey is unique. We begin by deeply understanding your context, then co-create frameworks and practices that serve your specific transformation.

**Engagements include:**
- Strategic planning sessions
- Leadership team development
- Facilitated offsites and retreats
- Ongoing advisory relationships (typically 3-6 month engagements)
- Cultural assessment and transformation support

**Investment:** Organizational work is customized based on scope and duration. Typical engagements range from $10,000-$25,000 per quarter.

## Community Gatherings

### Creating Space for Collective Transformation

Mount Purpose hosts regular gatherings in Columbus, Ohio—intimate spaces where leaders explore their transitions together, share wisdom from the valley, and discover they're not alone on the journey.

**What makes our gatherings different:**

**Intentional Curation**  
Small groups (typically 15-30 people), diverse perspectives, shared commitment to honest exploration. We choose quality of connection over quantity of attendees.

**Multiple Formats**  
Salons, workshops, panels, fireside conversations, storytelling circles. Each gathering designed for the specific moment and community need.

**Community Over Networking**  
We're building relationships, not collecting contacts. Depth, not breadth.

**Elevation of Story**  
Every gathering creates space for authentic sharing. We elevate voices that need to be heard.

**Practical Wisdom**  
Philosophy grounded in practice. You leave with frameworks, tools, and next steps—not just inspiration.

**Recent gatherings:**
- Lunar New Year Potluck (February 2024, Washington D.C.)
- LEAP with PURPOSE (February 2024, Washington D.C.)
- Women's Health in America (April 2024, National Press Club)

**Upcoming:** Columbus-based gatherings launching 2025. [Join the mailing list to be notified](/connect/).

## Not Sure Where to Start?

That's normal. Most people aren't certain which offering is right when they first reach out.

The best place to begin is a conversation. No obligation. No pressure. Just space to explore what you're navigating and how Mount Purpose might support your journey.

**Common questions we can address:**
- "I'm not sure if I need a guide or just time to figure it out myself."
- "Would this work for my organization or is it more for individuals?"
- "I'm interested in gatherings but don't know anyone in Columbus yet."
- "How do I know if I'm ready to invest in this kind of guidance?"

We'll help you find clarity. Even if Mount Purpose isn't the right fit, we'll point you toward resources or connections that might serve you better.
