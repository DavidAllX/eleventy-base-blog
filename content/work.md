## Individual Guidance

### One-on-One Support for Leaders in Transition

The journey from the first mountain to the second is rarely linear. You need a guide who understands the terrain—someone who's navigated the valley and knows what the ascent requires.

**Who this is for:**
- Leaders sensing there's a deeper mountain to climb
- Executives navigating career transitions or major life changes
- Entrepreneurs seeking to align their ventures with authentic purpose
- Anyone in the valley between mountains, uncertain of the path forward

**What we explore together:**
- Clarifying your values and principles when achievement metrics no longer satisfy
- Mapping where you are on the two-mountain journey
- Identifying what wants to emerge in your next chapter
- Building sustainable practices for purpose-aligned leadership
- Navigating organizational or career transitions with integrity

**How we work:**
- Initial conversation to understand your journey and explore fit
- Ongoing guidance tailored to your specific transition
- Practical frameworks and tools for each stage
- Access to the Mount Purpose community and gatherings

## Organizational Consulting

### Strategic Guidance for Purpose-Driven Organizations

Organizations, like individuals, face transitions. Mount Purpose helps teams navigate from conventional success metrics toward deeper alignment between mission, culture, and authentic impact.

**Who this is for:**
- Leadership teams seeking to align strategy with purpose
- Organizations navigating mission drift or cultural transformation
- Nonprofits and purpose-driven ventures scaling their impact
- Companies recognizing that profit alone isn't a sufficient north star

**What we work on:**
- **Mission Alignment:** Ensuring strategy, culture, and operations reflect your deepest purpose
- **Leadership Development:** Cultivating second-mountain thinking in your team
- **Organizational Transition:** Guiding transformation during growth, pivots, or cultural shifts
- **Purpose Integration:** Moving from mission statements to lived values
- **Community Building:** Creating spaces where your team can explore transformation together

**Approach:**
We don't offer one-size-fits-all solutions. Every organization's journey is unique. We begin by deeply understanding your context, then co-create frameworks and practices that serve your specific transformation.

**Engagements include:**
- Strategic planning sessions
- Leadership team development
- Facilitated offsites and retreats
- Ongoing advisory relationships
- Cultural assessment and transformation support

## Community Gatherings

### Creating Space for Collective Transformation

Mount Purpose hosts regular gatherings in Columbus, Ohio—intimate spaces where leaders can explore their transitions together, share wisdom from the valley, and discover they're not alone on the journey.

**What makes our gatherings different:**
- **Intentional curation:** Small groups, diverse perspectives, shared commitment to honest exploration
- **Multiple formats:** Salons, workshops, panels, fireside conversations
- **Community over networking:** We're building relationships, not collecting contacts
- **Integration of story:** Every gathering elevates voices and creates space for authentic sharing

**Past gatherings include:**
- Lunar New Year Potluck (February 2024)
- LEAP with PURPOSE (February 2024)
- Women's Health in America at the National Press Club (April 2024)

**Next steps:**

3. **Proposal** outlining how we might work together
4. **Begin** the work of transformation

## Investment

Engagements are customized based on scope, duration, and format. We believe in accessible guidance and work with individuals and organizations at various stages and resource levels.

During our initial conversation, we'll discuss what makes sense for your situation.

## Not Sure Where to Start?

That's normal. Most people aren't certain which path is right when they first reach out.

The best place to begin is a conversation. No obligation. Just space to explore what you're navigating and how Mount Purpose might support your journey.
