Mount Purpose didn't begin when I launched this website. It didn't even begin with the three gatherings I hosted in DC in 2024.

It began the day I walked away from my first mountain.

## Walking Away from the Summit

I had built a $5 million annual revenue social media agency. By conventional metrics, I had summited. Success. Revenue. Recognition. All the markers that tell you you've made it.

And then I looked at what I was building. At whose interests I was serving. At the distance between my principles and my practice.

So I walked away.

Not because I had another peak in sight. Not because I knew what came next. But because I understood, with sudden clarity, that using my talents for purposes misaligned with my values was a summit I could no longer stand on.

That's when the descent began.

## Down, Down, Down

They don't prepare you for the valley.

The first mountain teaches you to climb—to strive, to achieve, to prove. But no one mentions that the path to the second mountain goes down first. Way down. Through the dissolution of identity. Through the loss of the story you told yourself about who you were.

The valley is long. And dark. And necessary.

During Covid, I found myself on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington—in Beaver, a place so small it barely exists on maps. Ancient rainforest. Mountains that dwarf human ambition. And Dave Hahn, the Salmon Keeper, who understood something about cycles and seasons and the patience required for transformation.

In that liminal space, surrounded by old growth forest, I felt something shift. Not a return to the first mountain, but the first glimpse of a second one. Higher. Different. Built not on achievement but on alignment.

I called it Mount Ethos. A metaphor. The mountain of principle. The inward climb to a much taller peak.

## The DC Look Back

I moved back to Washington, DC with purpose in my heart. I had to return to what I thought would be the place of fire. But instead, I found ashes.

All that I was - was no more. What once was a beautiful lush garden surrounding a kingdom was grown over and a much darker forest. There I faced my shadow. The boy that I was -- that left it all for this quest.

Yet from that vantage point, that mountain and my purpose connected. Mount Purpose was born in Washington, DC. We hosted three events gathering 29 community members and elevating four storytellers. My last event was the start of a series called 'Health in America' where we intended to explore what is truly happening with America's health from the stories of its changemakers.

## Pennsylvania

After this event I knew that DC was the wrong place for me to build Mount Purpose. The grounds were no longer fertile for this kind of grassroots movement making. 

My uncle messaged me and invited me to move up to Pennsylvania to take a sabbatical and regain my strength. I took him up on the offer and reveled in the idea of connecting with the ancient land, and for the first time, use all of my talents and skills to help shoulder up with the family business, an apple cider winery.

## Coming Home

On October 13, my father died.

Returning home to Columbus, Ohio that night my work began to piece together a life, understanding the throughlines—something clarified. All these various steps along the way, my principled stand, the descent and the wandering and the experiments and the false starts, suddenly made sense.

This wasn't failure. This was the path. This was the shape of my story.

The valley wasn't a detour. It was the necessary preparation for what I'm climbing now.

## Mount Purpose: The Ascent

I see it clearly now. Mount Purpose. Not in DC, but headquartered here in Columbus, with a powerfully, meaningfully connected community. Not starting from scratch, but building on everything the valley taught me.

Ninety-seven events since 2010. Each one a step. Each gathering a practice in creating space for others navigating their own two-mountain journeys. The descent taught me what the ascent requires: rootedness, patience, community, and the courage to keep building even when the path isn't clear.

This website is a marker on that climb. A base camp. A place where the wisdom from those gatherings can ripple outward. Where others in their own valleys can find companionship. Where we can walk this path together.

## An Invitation

If you're reading this, you might be in your own valley. Or standing at the edge of your first mountain, sensing there's a second one you're meant to climb. Or already ascending, looking for companionship on the path.

Mount Purpose exists for this: to create spaces—digital and physical—where we can navigate these transitions together. Where we honor the descent as much as the ascent. Where we practice building lives aligned with our deepest principles, even when it's hard, even when it's unclear.

The second mountain is higher. The climb is longer. The view is worth it.

Welcome to Mount Purpose. Let's walk this path together.
