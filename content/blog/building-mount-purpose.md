Mount Purpose didn't begin when I launched this website yesterday. It didn't even begin with the three gatherings I hosted in DC earlier this year.

It began the day I walked away from my first mountain.

## Walking Away from the Summit

I had built a $5 million annual revenue social media agency. By conventional metrics, I had summited. Success. Revenue. Recognition. All the markers that tell you you've made it.

And then I looked at what I was building. At whose interests I was serving. At the distance between my principles and my practice.

So I walked away.

Not because I had another peak in sight. Not because I knew what came next. But because I understood, with sudden clarity, that using my talents for purposes misaligned with my values was a summit I could no longer stand on.

That's when the descent began.

## Down, Down, Down

They don't prepare you for the valley.

The first mountain teaches you to climb—to strive, to achieve, to prove. But no one mentions that the path to the second mountain goes down first. Way down. Through the dissolution of identity. Through the loss of the story you told yourself about who you were.

The valley is long. And dark. And necessary.

During Covid, I found myself on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington—in Beaver, a place so small it barely exists on maps. Ancient rainforest. Mountains that dwarf human ambition. And Dave Hahn, the Salmon Keeper, who understood something about cycles and seasons and the patience required for transformation.

My uncle, David Sterner the Cidermaker, knew it too—that some fruits need time to ferment, to become something richer than their original form.

In that liminal space, surrounded by those who understood the long work of becoming, I felt something shift. Not a return to the first mountain, but the first glimpse of a second one. Higher. Different. Built not on achievement but on alignment.

I called it Mount Ethos. The mountain of principle. The inward climb to a much taller peak.

## The DC Attempt

I moved to Washington, DC with Mount Purpose in my heart. Three events. Four storytellers. Twenty-nine community members who showed up with open hearts.

**Lunar New Year Potluck** at Cielo. **LEAP with PURPOSE** at Pow Pow. **Women's Health in America** at the National Press Club.

Each gathering felt sacred. Like we were building something that mattered. But I didn't have the energy. The resources. The rooted community to sustain it.

Some seeds need different soil.

I'm grateful beyond words for those who stepped forward to bring Mount Purpose to life in DC—who believed in the vision enough to show up, to hold space, to help me learn what these gatherings needed to become. You know who you are. You made it possible.

## Coming Home

Last month, my father died.

Returning home to Columbus, Ohio for his story—sitting with family, piecing together a life, understanding the throughlines—something clarified. All these various steps along the way, the descent and the wandering and the experiments and the false starts, suddenly made sense.

This wasn't failure. This was the path.

The valley wasn't a detour. It was the necessary preparation for what I'm climbing now.

## Mount Purpose: The Ascent

I see it clearly now. Mount Purpose. Not in DC, but here in Columbus, with a powerfully, meaningfully connected community. Not starting from scratch, but building on everything the valley taught me.

Ninety-seven events since 2010. Each one a step. Each gathering a practice in creating space for others navigating their own two-mountain journeys. The descent taught me what the ascent requires: rootedness, patience, community, and the courage to keep building even when the path isn't clear.

This website is a marker on that climb. A base camp. A place where the wisdom from those gatherings can ripple outward. Where others in their own valleys can find companionship. Where we can walk this path together.

## Honoring the Guides

No one climbs alone.

Dave Hahn, the Salmon Keeper in Beaver, Washington, who taught me about cycles and patience. My uncle, David Sterner the Cidermaker, who showed me the alchemy of time and transformation. My dear group of close friends and muses—you know who you are—who held space when I couldn't hold it myself.

The twenty-nine community members who showed up to those early DC gatherings and made Mount Purpose real. The Columbus community now surrounding this work with roots deep enough to sustain it.

And my father, whose death and story helped me finally connect all the pieces.

## An Invitation

If you're reading this, you might be in your own valley. Or standing at the edge of your first mountain, sensing there's a second one you're meant to climb. Or already ascending, looking for companionship on the path.

Mount Purpose exists for this: to create spaces—digital and physical—where we can navigate these transitions together. Where we honor the descent as much as the ascent. Where we practice building lives aligned with our deepest principles, even when it's hard, even when it's unclear.

The second mountain is higher. The climb is longer. The view is worth it.

Welcome to Mount Purpose. Let's walk this path together.
