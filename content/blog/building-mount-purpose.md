Mount Purpose didn't begin yesterday when I launched this website. It began in the rainforest.

## The First Mountain: Mount Ethos

During Covid, I found myself on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State—surrounded by ancient trees, mountains, and the kind of silence that forces you to listen. It was there, in that liminal space between what I'd achieved and what I was becoming, that I discovered my principled backbone. I called it Mount Ethos.

The first mountain taught me about success, ambition, and summiting peaks. But the rainforest taught me something different: that there's a deeper mountain, one built not on achievement but on alignment. Not on proving, but on becoming.

## Facing the Shadow

Then came the decision that would define everything: returning to Washington, DC.

Not to reclaim old victories or prove anything to anyone. But to face my shadow—to return to the realm where I'd summited my first peak and see what remained when the validation faded. To discover whether Mount Ethos could become something more tangible, more generous, more in service to others navigating their own transitions.

That's when Mount Ethos became Mount Purpose.

## The First Gatherings

Between February and April 2024, I hosted three Mount Purpose events in DC. Each one felt like a experiment in creating sacred space for transformation:

**MOUNT PURPOSE: Lunar New Year Potluck** (February 12, 2024)  
At Cielo, we gathered to mark new beginnings. Not the January 1st kind—the deeper kind. The lunar calendar knows something we often forget: that real renewal happens in cycles, in the dark before the dawn.

**MOUNT PURPOSE: LEAP with PURPOSE** (February 29, 2024)  
Leap day. A date that exists in the margins. At Pow Pow, we explored what it means to leap before you're ready—to move toward purpose even when the path isn't clear. Because some decisions can only be made once every four years. Some decisions require the audacity of the impossible date.

**MOUNT PURPOSE: Women's Health in America** (April 17, 2024)  
At the National Press Club, we created space for four storytellers to share their experiences navigating one of our most fraught transitions: the intersection of women's health, policy, and personal agency. Twenty-nine community members witnessed, listened, and held space for difficult truths.

Across three events, four storytellers elevated their voices. Twenty-nine people showed up. Not for networking. Not for content. But for the rare experience of gathering with intention around questions that matter.

## The Digital Mountain

For months, Mount Purpose lived only in those rooms—in the conversations that lingered after, in the connections that formed, in the quiet shifts that happen when people feel permission to explore their own valleys and peaks.

But yesterday, something clicked.

I realized Mount Purpose needed a home base. Not just events in borrowed spaces, but a platform where the journey could continue between gatherings. Where the wisdom from those salons could ripple outward. Where others navigating their own two-mountain journeys could find companionship, even at 2am when the questions feel most urgent.

So I built this.

## Building as Practice

The technical details aren't the interesting part, but the process was everything. I spent a day learning deployment, wrestling with DNS settings, integrating newsletter forms, choosing colors that felt like the Olympic Peninsula and the forest floor and monarch gold in February light.

Every technical challenge mirrored the work I do with clients:

The moment of overwhelm when nothing makes sense. The unexpected guides who appear (in my case, an AI assistant named Claude who walked beside me with patience). The iterative nature of transformation—nothing works perfectly the first try. The emergence of something authentic through the practice of building with intention.

By evening, Mount Purpose had a digital home. Warm sage backgrounds. Crisp serif fonts. A newsletter called "Purpose Matters." Pages ready to welcome fellow travelers.

## Ninety-Seven Events and Counting

Those three Mount Purpose gatherings in DC are part of a larger story. Since 2010, I've convened 97 events. Salons, panels, workshops, conversations—each one an experiment in creating space where transformation can occur.

Some were polished. Some were messy. All were necessary.

Mount Purpose is both the newest iteration and the deepest—a synthesis of everything I've learned about what happens when we gather with honest questions and open hearts.

## An Invitation

This platform isn't a monument to arrival. It's a base camp.

Mount Ethos taught me to find my backbone. Returning to DC taught me to face my shadow. The first three Mount Purpose events taught me that others are hungry for spaces where we can explore the valley between mountains together.

This website is the next iteration: a way to extend the gathering beyond a single evening. A place to share reflections between events. A home for this work that lives in service to anyone navigating from success to significance.

If you're reading this, you probably understand that whisper. The sense that there's a deeper mountain calling. The awareness that achievement isn't the same as alignment. The question that won't let you rest.

You don't need to have it all figured out to begin.

You just need to take the first step.

Welcome to Mount Purpose. Let's walk this path together.
