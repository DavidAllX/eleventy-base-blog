You did everything right.

You set ambitious goals. You worked hard. You climbed the mountain. You reached the summit.

And then you looked around and thought: *Is this all there is?*

If you've ever felt that way—if you've achieved everything you set out to do but still feel like something's missing—I want you to know something important:

**You're not broken.**

You're hearing the whisper.

## The Whisper at the Summit

Today, I'm launching something new: a video series about the two-mountain journey. It's about the transition from achievement to alignment, from success to significance.

The first video in this series is about that moment at the summit—when you've accomplished what you set out to do, but instead of satisfaction, you feel... empty. Restless. Like you're supposed to be somewhere else, doing something else, becoming someone else.

## What You'll Learn

In this video, I explain:

- Why the question "Is this all there is?" emerges at the summit
- The difference between the first and second mountain
- What it means when the whisper gets louder
- Why this isn't a crisis—it's an invitation

I also share my own story of standing at that summit, hearing that whisper, and what happened when I finally started listening.

## The Two Mountains

The first mountain is about achievement. It's about proving yourself, building your career, earning recognition, accumulating success.

The second mountain is about alignment. It's about meaning, contribution, becoming who you were meant to be.

Most people spend their twenties and thirties climbing the first mountain. Some reach the top. Some realize halfway up that they're climbing the wrong mountain.

But almost everyone who achieves traditional success eventually hears the whisper.

## This Isn't a Crisis

Here's what I want you to understand: this feeling isn't a crisis. It's not a breakdown. It's not a sign that something went wrong.

It's an invitation.

An invitation to climb a second mountain. Not because the first one didn't matter—it did. But because there's another summit worth reaching. One that's measured differently. One that feels different when you get there.

## Three Questions

At the end of the video, I leave you with three reflection questions:

1. What whisper have you been ignoring?
2. What would it cost you to keep ignoring it?
3. What might be possible if you finally listened?

I'd love to hear your answers. Watch the video, sit with those questions, and let me know what comes up for you.

## What's Next

This is video 1 in a three-part series:

- **Video 1 (Today):** Why Does Success Feel Empty?
- **Video 2 (Monday):** Why You Can't Skip the Valley
- **Video 3 (Next Week):** Redefining Success on the Second Mountain

If you're navigating this transition—if you've heard the whisper and you're ready to listen—I invite you to:

- [Subscribe to the Mount Purpose newsletter](https://mountpurpose.com/connect)
- [Explore the Two-Mountain Journey framework](https://mountpurpose.com/journey)
- [Learn about working together](https://mountpurpose.com/work)

And most importantly: be kind to yourself. This transition is disorienting. It's supposed to be.

You're not lost. You're exactly where you need to be. Keep climbing.

*P.S. If this resonates, I'd be grateful if you'd share the video with someone who might be hearing their own whisper. Sometimes we just need to know we're not alone.*
