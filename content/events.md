# Events & Media

## The Practice of Gathering

Since 2010, David has been creating spaces where transformation happens—not through lectures or presentations, but through the alchemy of gathered humans exploring honest questions together.

From intimate salons in living rooms to signature events at venues like the Guggenheim Museum and Columbus Museum of Art, each gathering is designed with intention: to elevate voices, create community, and hold space for the transitions that matter most.

## The Philosophy of Gathering

Not all events are created equal. Mount Purpose gatherings are designed with specific intentions:

**Elevation over extraction**  
We elevate storytellers and their experiences rather than extracting content for consumption.

**Community over networking**  
We're building relationships rooted in shared exploration, not collecting business cards.

**Depth over breadth**  
Small, intentional gatherings create space for transformation that large conferences cannot.

**Story as teacher**  
The most profound wisdom often comes through lived experience, honestly shared.

## Belly of the Beast Life Stories with David All

<div style="padding: 2em; background-color: var(--background-secondary); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--color-accent); margin: 2em 0;">
  <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">A Podcast About Transformation</h3>
  <p><strong>Belly of the Beast Life Stories with David All</strong> explores the unwanted changes that trigger major transformations in life—the caterpillar to chrysalis (monarch gold!) to butterfly moments that remake us.</p>
  
  <p>Through intimate conversations and personal storytelling, the podcast examines what happens when life breaks us open: abandonment, death, addiction, health, loss, crisis. The moments we didn't choose but that chose us.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Season 3: Fatherlessness</strong><br>
  Following the recent death of David's father, Donald, Season 3 continues to explore the terrain of fatherlessness—what it means to lose a father, to never have had one, to become one, or to navigate the complex inheritance of father wounds and father gifts.</p>
  
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><em>The podcast emerged from David's own journey through the valley—before he had language for the two-mountain framework, he was living the transformation.</em></p>

## Beyond the Numbers: Burning Man & Global Community Building

Before Mount Purpose took shape, David served as top advisor to Burning Man and its founders, including Larry Harvey and Marian Goodell. The work focused on connecting the dots from their single largest event in the Nevada desert to a global year-round community—translating principles of radical inclusion, gifting, and transformation into scalable practices.

This experience of helping build global community around shared values deeply informed Mount Purpose's approach to gathering: how to create containers for transformation, how to honor both the local and the global, and how to build sustainable community around what matters most.

*"Ninety-seven events taught me this: transformation doesn't happen in isolation. It happens when we gather with honest questions, open hearts, and the courage to witness each other's becoming."* — David All
