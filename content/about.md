# About Mount Purpose

Mount Purpose guides leaders through the transition from success to significance—from the first mountain of achievement to the second mountain of purpose.

We work with CEOs, founders, and leaders who've reached the summit and heard a whisper: *Is this all there is?* We guide those navigating the valley. And we support those beginning the climb toward something deeper.

This isn't coaching. **It's trusted counsel during your most significant transitions.**

## The Guide: David All

### The First Mountain

David climbed fast. By his late twenties, he'd worked as speechwriter for the U.S. Senate, communications director for House Leadership, and pioneered social media strategy on Capitol Hill. Media called him **"Karl Rove 2.0."**

In 2005, he founded David All Group, the first social media agency in Washington, D.C. The client roster included Google, Intel, HP, Burning Man, and Fortune 500 companies. Annual revenue: $4.6 million. Every door was open.

At the summit, David walked away.

> "I always saw myself more as a unifier. Ultimately, I left [politics] because I'm not a divisive person. I didn't want to use these superpowers to be divisive."  
> — David All, The Washington Post

Not from failure. From misalignment. The work that brought him to the peak couldn't take him where he needed to go.

### The Valley

The descent was long. David stumbled, experimented, created:

**Civichacks** - 35+ gatherings for civic innovators inspired by Barack Obama's National Day of Civic Hacking

**Belly of the Beast podcast** - Exploring the unwanted changes that trigger transformation

**Recovery Deserts research** - [Published with Ohio State University backing](https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/entertainment/human-interest/2021/05/13/recovery-deserts-project-gets-academic-backing-ohio-state-study/5075166001/), identifying areas without addiction treatment resources

**Franklin County Opiate Task Force** - Creating the first deliverable from their action plan: resource cards for pregnant mothers seeking support

**Blockchain innovation** - Named "Blockchain Breakthrough for a Better World" by Coinbase and HeroX

**Olympic athlete coaching** - Helping Dr. Abby Johnston McGrath craft her keynote story

> "David made the story-building process fun and taught me skills that I know will help in all facets of life. If you have a need in your life to be in touch with your personal story, work with David."  
> — Dr. Abby Johnston McGrath, Olympic Silver Medalist, Diving, Team USA

Through it all, he was learning the topography of transformation.

### Mount Purpose

During COVID, on the Olympic Peninsula surrounded by ancient forest, David saw it clearly: **Mount Ethos**—the mountain of principle. Not built on achievement, but alignment with character.

He returned to D.C. and launched Mount Purpose, hosting three gatherings in early 2024. Powerful events. Wrong soil.

His uncle invited him to Pennsylvania—18 months on a 110-acre farm, helping build an [apple cider wine business](https://lscider.com) while gaining perspective. David was named a finalist for Rising Star Award in hospitality for creating transformational gathering spaces.

When his father died in October 2024, David returned to Columbus. Sitting with family, understanding throughlines, everything clarified. The seeds he'd planted had become an orchard.

> **Mount Purpose found its home in Columbus—where David has deep community, where 97 events since 2010 can grow into something sustainable.**

The climb has begun.

## What Makes This Different

David doesn't just understand the two-mountain journey intellectually. **He's lived it**—summit, descent, valley, emergence.

He brings two decades of elite capability:

### Strategic Advisory

David serves as trusted advisor to leaders in transition—reviewing board communications, advising on reputation during vulnerable moments, coaching high-stakes presentations, providing strategic counsel during crises.

### Communications Mastery

From Capitol Hill to Olympic athletes, David has crafted narratives for the highest-stakes moments. He knows how a single word change can transform impact.

### Organizational Transformation

He's guided organizations from Better Business Bureau to Burning Man through profound transitions—always focusing on alignment between mission and action.

### Legacy Work

Having guided his father's [honorable exit](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/columbus-oh/donald-seeger-12567204), David helps leaders plan beyond their lifetime—obituaries that capture essence, foundations for lasting impact, wisdom documented for future generations.

> **Tiny alignments, a single word change, makes all the difference—even in how we say goodbye.**

## The Philosophy

Transformation doesn't happen in isolation. It happens in community—through honest questions, open hearts, and the courage to witness each other's becoming.

**Mount Purpose creates those spaces through:**

- **One-on-one advisory** for leaders in significant transition
- **Organizational consulting** for mission-driven entities  
- **Curated gatherings** where leaders explore the terrain together

The valley isn't failure. It's preparation for a different kind of climb.
