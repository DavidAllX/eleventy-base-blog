## The Guide: David All

David's journey exemplifies the two-mountain path he now helps others navigate.

### The First Mountain: Scaling Heights in Politics & Digital Media

David climbed his first mountain fast and high.

At 22, he managed a congressional campaign. By his late twenties, he'd served as speechwriter for the U.S. Senate, communications director for House Leadership, and communications director for a Senate race in Michigan.

But David saw something others didn't: the intersection of politics and emerging technology. He pioneered the use of social media, blogging, and YouTube on Capitol Hill—becoming one of the first to harness interactive strategies on the campaign trail. He was recognized internationally as "Top 10 Changing the World of Internet and Politics" in Paris.

His commentary appeared on NPR, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, and C-SPAN. His thought leadership was published in The New York Times, Politico, Washington Post, PR News, and Huffington Post.

In 2005, he founded David All Group, the first social media agency in Washington, D.C. Working with global leaders in elected office, campaigns, governments, and Fortune 500 companies including Google, Intel, HP, Lenovo, and major organizations like Burning Man, PhRMA, American Beverage Association, and the Consumer Electronics Association. Major media outlets were calling him **"Karl Rove 2.0."**

By the time the business hit $4.6 million in annual revenue, David was at the summit. All doors were open. His credibility was at its peak.

And that's when he heard the whisper.

### The Descent: Choosing Purpose Over Power

*"I always saw myself more as a unifier. Ultimately, I left [politics] because I'm not a divisive person. I didn't want to use these superpowers to be divisive."*  
— David All, The Washington Post

At the height of his success, David made a choice that baffled his peers: he walked away.

Not because of failure. Not because of scandal. But because the work no longer aligned with who he was becoming. The business that brought him to the summit couldn't take him where he needed to go.

[As Columbus Monthly reported](https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/entertainment/human-interest/2017/08/02/people-to-watch-david-all/20031290007/), the decision came with a cost. Partnership disagreements. The business evaporating. Societal pressure suggesting he'd made the biggest mistake of his life.

For the first time, David wasn't in control. He had entered the valley.

### The Valley: Stumbling, Creating, Discovering

The valley was long. And dark. And generative.

David stumbled. He tried climbing smaller mountains, attempting to regain what was lost rather than moving toward what was calling. Each attempt taught him something the first mountain never could.

**He created Civichacks**, inspired by Barack Obama's National Day of Civic Hacking, organizing 35+ events including Startup Storytellers and Test City Storytellers.

**He became a consultant** for organizations like the Better Business Bureau and Ohio nonprofits, guiding them through their own transformations.

**He launched Belly of the Beast: Life Stories**, a podcast exploring the unwanted changes that trigger major transformations. The caterpillar to chrysalis to butterfly moments. He needed to hear from others—to know he wasn't alone.

**He reconnected with his father** at age 36, building a meaningful relationship after years apart. A story of love, forgiveness, and the stubbornness required to bridge a decades-long divide. His father's recent death became a clarifying moment, helping David understand the throughline of his own journey.

**He co-created a substance abuse clinic** in an underserved community, which led to discovering "Recovery Deserts"—areas without adequate addiction treatment resources. David guided stakeholders to bring his vision to life through their talents and energy. In 2021, [the groundbreaking research was published](https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/entertainment/human-interest/2021/05/13/recovery-deserts-project-gets-academic-backing-ohio-state-study/5075166001/) with backing from Ohio State University. His leadership on the opioid epidemic earned him recognition as ["Person to Watch"](https://www.columbusmonthly.com/story/entertainment/human-interest/2017/08/02/people-to-watch-david-all/20031290007/) in Columbus, Ohio.

**He led the Franklin County Opiate Task Force** to create the first deliverable from their action plan: a resource pocket card for pregnant mothers seeking addiction support. Simple, well-designed, current information—surprisingly hard to find.

**He brought to life a blockchain product** named by Coinbase and HeroX a "Blockchain Breakthrough for a Better World."

**He worked with Olympic Silver Medalist Dr. Abby Johnston McGrath**, helping her craft and deliver a keynote that wove together her roles as elite athlete, medical doctor, and mother.

*"David made the story-building process fun and taught me skills that I know will help in all facets of life. If you have a need in your life to be in touch with your personal story, work with David, he'll help you achieve your goals with professionalism and grace."*  
— Dr. Abby Johnston McGrath, Olympic Silver Medalist, Diving, Team USA

Through all of this—the creating, the consulting, the connecting—David was learning the topography of transformation. He was discovering what it means to descend from one mountain and begin the climb toward another.

### Mount Ethos: Feeling Purpose

During COVID, David found himself on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington—surrounded by ancient rainforest and mountains that dwarf human ambition. In that liminal space, while volunteering to help ensure the salmon can achieve their purpose to give life with a guide named Dave Hahn the [Salmon Keeper](https://youtu.be/cC0FXXhUsa8), something crystallized.

He called it Mount Ethos: the mountain of principle. The inward climb to a much taller peak. Not built on achievement, but on alignment with your character. Ethos, or reputation and backbone of the individual, is what Aristotle long ago noted as the most persuasive mode of communication. And it's what he called his consulting company.

### Mount Purpose: The Ascent

After COVID, David returned to Washington, D.C., attempting to bring Washington back together. He created FOUND3R to [shift the narrative about blockchain technology](https://www.decential.io/articles/found3r-town-hall-in-new-york-has-a-simple-message-web3-is-only-getting-started) and created Mount Purpose to bring a community of changemakers together. He hosted three gatherings in early 2024—Lunar New Year Potluck, LEAP with PURPOSE, Women's Health in America at the National Press Club—elevating four storytellers and connecting 29 community members.

The events were powerful. But the soil wasn't right.

At the moment David realized he had to leave Washington, DC, his uncle, Dr. David C. Sterner, reached out and invited him to move up to his 110-acre farm near State College, Pennsylvania with a goal of getting a fresh perspective (a "sabbatical" as his uncle framed it) while helping the family bring their [apple cider wine business](https://lscider.com) to life. Over 18-months, David succeeded in both goals. In 2025, David was named a finalist for the Happy Valley Adventure Bureau's Rising Star Award in hospitality, recognizing his unique approach to creating transformational gathering spaces for the family business.

This 18-month sabbatical once again provided space to slow down. To be creative. To have a deeper commune with family, nature and his inner world. He developed new meditation practices, gratitude techniques and grieving rituals. New ideas and methods that he aims to explore more deeply in community and through individual work.

When his father died in October 2025, David returned home to Columbus, Ohio. Sitting with family, piecing together a life, understanding the throughlines—everything clarified. Through the experience of leading his [father's honorable exit from this plane](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/columbus-oh/donald-seeger-12567204) and discovered the final missing pieces to understand the man his father was and the shared sense of duty and honor which guides him.

As David reconnected with his beloved community, for the first time he heard about the impact of his work directly from those that had either shared their story at one of his events or was otherwise meaningfully impacted. The seeds he planted had become an orchard.

Mount Purpose wasn't meant for D.C. It was meant for Columbus, where David has a deeply rooted community. Where he can build something sustainable. Where the 97 events he's convened since 2010 at venues like the National Press Club, Guggenheim Museum, Postmasters Gallery, Bright Moments NYC, Columbus Museum of Art, and The Capital Factory in Austin—can grow into something even more meaningful.

In this context, Mount Purpose was born again. It started as so many things do in his life, with words filling a page. Those four words: Wisdom. Love. Healing. Community.

And the climb up has begun. Let's go.

## What Makes This Work Different

David doesn't just understand the two-mountain journey intellectually. He's lived it—the summit, the descent, the valley, the emergence of a second peak.

More importantly, he brings **two decades of elite-level capability** to the work:

### Strategic Communications & Storytelling
From Capitol Hill to Olympic athletes, David has crafted narratives and guided delivery for the highest-stakes moments. He understands how tiny adjustments in an email to your board, the framing of a campaign message, or the structure of a TED talk can transform impact.

### Digital Strategy & Reputation
As a pioneer in digital politics and social media strategy, David monitors the ambient reputation of leaders navigating transition—ensuring you don't lose ground or get distracted during vulnerable moments.

### Organizational Transformation
From Better Business Bureau to Ohio Living to substance abuse clinics to global communities like Burning Man, David has guided organizations through profound transitions. Most effective when invited to serve as advisor to CEOs on all aspects of their personal story and professional sphere of influence—always focusing on alignment between mission and action.

### Actionable Deliverables

Mount Purpose isn't theoretical. David works as a trusted advisor to leaders navigating significant transitions—reviewing everything they touch, helping them think through decisions, and ensuring alignment between their evolving purpose and public presence.

**The advisory relationship includes:**
- Reviewing board communications, speeches, and public-facing materials
- Advising on reputation and digital presence during transitions
- Brainstorming thematic concepts for campaigns or initiatives
- Coaching on high-stakes presentations and delivery
- Strategic counsel during challenging moments (lawsuits, media storms, organizational crises)
- Ensuring tiny alignments—the single word change that makes all the difference

**When needed, David can also:**
- Connect you with his network of specialists
- Provide direct support on critical deliverables
- Help frame and position your next chapter

This isn't about doing the work for you. It's about having someone who understands both the mountain you're climbing and how to communicate from that elevation—someone who can see what you can't see when you're in the middle of the journey.

### Beyond the Second Mountain: Legacy & Honorable Exit

David helps leaders think beyond their own journey to the impact that outlasts them. Having recently guided his father's honorable exit and witnessed the power of a well-crafted legacy, he understands what it means to prepare for the third mountain—the one that exists beyond our lifetime.

**Legacy work includes:**
- Crafting obituaries and farewell narratives that capture a life's true essence
- Collaborating on trusts, foundations, and vehicles for lasting impact
- Identifying and preserving stories that need to be told
- Creating processes for graceful transitions of leadership and influence
- Documenting wisdom and principles for future generations
- Planning honorable exits that reflect a life lived with purpose

Most leaders avoid thinking about their ending. But the leaders who do this work with intention—who prepare their exit as carefully as they climbed—leave something more valuable than wealth or achievement. They leave wisdom, story, and a map for those who follow.

**Tiny alignments, a single word change, makes all the difference—even in how we say goodbye.**

---

## The Philosophy

David believes transformation doesn't happen in isolation. It happens when we gather with honest questions, open hearts, and the courage to witness each other's becoming.

Mount Purpose creates those spaces—through one-on-one guidance, organizational consulting, and carefully curated gatherings where leaders explore the terrain between mountains together.

The work is rooted in a simple truth: **the valley isn't failure. It's preparation for a different kind of climb.**
