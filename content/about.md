# About Mount Purpose

Mount Purpose guides leaders through the transition from success to significance—from the first mountain of achievement to the second mountain of purpose.

We work with CEOs, founders, and leaders who've reached the summit and heard a whisper: *Is this all there is?* We guide those navigating the valley. And we support those beginning the climb toward something deeper.

**This isn't coaching. It's trusted counsel during your most significant transitions.**

## The Guide: David All

David climbed fast—Capitol Hill speechwriter, pioneer in digital politics, founder of a $4.6M agency. Media called him **"Karl Rove 2.0."** His client roster included Google, Intel, HP, and Burning Man. Every door was open.

At the summit, he walked away. Not from failure, but misalignment.

> "I always saw myself more as a unifier. Ultimately, I left [politics] because I'm not a divisive person. I didn't want to use these superpowers to be divisive."  
> — David All, The Washington Post

What followed: a long valley of experimentation, loss, and discovery.

Blockchain innovation named "Breakthrough for a Better World." Olympic athlete coaching. 97 gatherings since 2010.

When his father died in October 2024, David returned to Columbus. Everything clarified. Mount Purpose found its home—not in D.C., but where David has deep community and roots.

- Communications Director for House Leadership
- Founded first social media agency in Washington, D.C.

### Organizational Transformation

Most effective when invited to serve as advisor to CEOs on all aspects of their personal story and professional sphere—always focusing on alignment between mission and action.

### Legacy & Honorable Exit Planning

Having guided his father's [honorable exit](https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/columbus-oh/donald-seeger-12567204), David helps leaders think beyond their lifetime—crafting obituaries that capture essence, creating foundations for lasting impact, documenting wisdom for future generations.

## The Philosophy

Transformation doesn't happen in isolation. It happens in community—through honest questions, open hearts, and the courage to witness each other's becoming.

Mount Purpose creates those spaces through one-on-one advisory, organizational consulting, and carefully curated gatherings where leaders explore the terrain together.

<blockquote style="font-size: 1.5rem; text-align: center; margin: 3em 0; border-left: none; background: none; padding: 0;">
The valley isn't failure. It's preparation for a different kind of climb.
