<div class="message-box">
	<h3 style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 1.3rem;">Welcome to the Journey</h3>
	<p>You've achieved success. Built something meaningful. Reached the summit of your first mountain. Yet something whispers: <em>Is this all there is?</em></p>
	<p>That whisper isn't doubt—it's invitation. An invitation to a deeper mountain, where achievement transforms into impact, and success becomes significance.</p>
	<p><strong>Mount Purpose</strong> guides leaders and organizations through this profound transition. We help you navigate the valley between mountains, map your unique path forward, and discover what it means to lead with authentic purpose.</p>
	<p><em>Your transformation begins with a single step. We're here to walk beside you.</em></p>
